          <h1>My journey starts at ITHS - Göteborg</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light">I've always been fascinated by computer, albeit only hardware side and gaming, what made me considering Web Development, was; to be fully transparent, a stable career path, however the more I dabble and learned about all these classes,variables,functions etc the more I wanted, I was ready to throw myself into it, even if it means failing or dissapointing myself. If I don't have the knowledge I can assure you that I will make up with my passion.</p>

            <h1>Major Project</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-light">
              After alot of trying and figuring out, We we're to begin starting to look for our first internship which would last us 8weeks, I was contacted by a person who also went to the same school as I was and wanted me in her team, unfortunately I can't show because the project was still ongoing at the time, but I could describe the idea and how we deployed it, We was going to make a auction website similiar to tradera.se, the site was was suppose to connect to "auction" engine the company had created using Goolang and RedisDB. We started to deploy our own database using SQLite and fetching the data from the RedisDB and inserted it into our SQL Database, which we then later fetched using async/await, I was considering promise based fetching but, both me and my co-programmer didn't have enough knowledge so we had to choose. either promise .then or async/await.
